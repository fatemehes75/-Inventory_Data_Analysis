# Data_Analysis_with_Excel
Transforming and Analyzing Inventory and Sales Data

In these projects, I followed these steps:
* Clean up the data before running any kind of analysis on it.
  - Spell Checking
  - Handling empty rows using filters
  - Handling duplicate data using conditional filtering
  - Formatting data
  - Trimming white space
  - Merging columns
* Utilizing formulas to automate calculations
* Utilizing Vlookup, Hlookup and Xlookup.
* Creating Pivot tables for the analysis phase.
* Using data visualization for data analysis (Histogram, Scatter Plot).
* Dashboard Design: A well-organized and visually appealing dashboard improves user experience, making data easier to interpret and decisions easier to make.
