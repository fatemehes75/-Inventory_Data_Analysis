Transforming and Analyzing Fleet Inventory Data

## About dataset:
**Fleet Equipment Inventory**
This dataset contains a list of Montgomery County Fleet equipment (vehicle) inventory and status (readiness).

In this final project, I followed a scenario of a recently hired Junior Data Analyst in a local government office, who has been tasked with:
* Importing some data from another department which relates to inventory information about their fleet of vehicles.
* Cleaning up the data before you can start to run any kind of analysis on it.
  - Spell Checking
  - Handling empty rows using filters
  - Handling duplicate data using conditional filtering
  - Formatting data
  - Trimming white space
  - Merging columns 
* Utilizing Vlookup and Hlookup.
* Creating Pivot tables for the analysis phase.
* Using data visualization for data analysis (Histogram, Scatter Plot)
